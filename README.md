# 🅿️ Mawaqef Parking Management System

A robust and user-friendly parking management system developed using Agile methodology, leveraging modern web technologies like Django and React to provide seamless parking spot management and real-time virtual sensor simulation.

## 📝 Overview

The Mawaqef Parking Management System is designed to streamline parking operations by enabling authorized operators to manage parking spots, view parking maps, and simulate sensor behavior. Developed as a part of an academic project, this system adheres to industry best practices and agile development principles.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🚗 Parking Spot Management

- **Create Parking Spot Maps**: Generate parking spot maps by specifying dimensions and orientations.
- **Automatic Spot Generation**: Automatically create parking spots based on map configurations.
- **Virtual Sensors**: Simulate sensor behavior to monitor parking spot status in real time.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Display and manage parking spots in a tabular format with real-time updates.

### 🔑 Operator Authorization

- **Secure Access**: Ensure only authorized operators can access and manage the system.
- **Token Authentication**: Validate operator sessions with a secure token-based authentication mechanism.

### 🗂️ Additional Features

- **Issues-Reporting**: Built-in functionality for operators to take and manage reported issues.
- **Dynamic Spot Interaction**: Change parking spot statuses and colors interactively through the dashboard.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Django, for robust and scalable server-side logic.
- **Frontend**: React with Vite, for a modern and responsive user interface.
- **Version Control**: Git, for collaborative development and project tracking.

## 🧩 Software Design Principles

- **Agile Methodology**: Ensured iterative and incremental development with regular feedback.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Facilitated modular and reusable code.
- **RESTful API Design**: Enabled smooth communication between the frontend and backend.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Use Git to clone the project to your local machine.
2. **Set Up Backend**: Install Python dependencies, configure the database, and run migrations.
3. **Set Up Frontend**: Install Node.js dependencies using Vite.
4. **Run the Application**: Start both the Django and React servers to access the system.

## 🏆 Key Achievements

- Implemented a fully functional operator dashboard for managing parking spots and maps.
- Simulated real-time sensor behavior with dynamic updates.
- Successfully integrated Django and React for seamless user experience.
- Delivered the project on time, adhering to Agile principles.
